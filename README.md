# Web store with Midtrans Payment.

Create a simple e-commerce or web store using Next.js, and integrate with Midtrans for its payment gateway.

## Getting Started

```bash
  clone repo:
   ssh: git clone git@github.com:mamsul/estore-midtrans.git
   https: git clone https://github.com/mamsul/estore-midtrans.git

  create .env file

  npm install
  npm run dev

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
